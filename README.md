# Password-based-door-lock-System-using-arduino

Science and technology have advanced our lives in many ways, facilitating industrialization and modernization. Among the many sophisticated devices enhancing our lives is the password-based locking system, a modern electronic lock system.
This project, Password Based Door Lock System, is designed using an Arduino UNO. When the correct code or password is entered, the door unlocks, allowing access to the secured area. This system replaces old-fashioned mechanical locks with advanced techniques combining mechanical and electronic devices, resulting in highly intelligent and efficient locking systems.

## Features
- Electronic Code Lock System : Utilizes Arduino UNO to control the actuating load, providing a secure and efficient locking mechanism.
- Keypad Input: A 4x4 keypad is used to enter the password.
- Password Verification: The entered password is compared with a preset password. If correct, the system opens the door using a servo motor and displays the door status on an LCD.
- Security Alert: If the wrong password is entered multiple times, a buzzer is activated.
- Real-time Notifications: The system sends a text message to the homeowner about any security breach.
